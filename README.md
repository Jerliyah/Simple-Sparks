Presented by: [From Dust to Minimal](https://fromdusttominimal.tumblr.com/)<br>
Found on: [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/)

### Features
- Minimalist

<br/><br/><br/><br/>


## Black Card

![Black card demo. The scene is dark, a black card with that says '::J::' (my trademark) in white letters moves from the bottom of the screen to the center. As it moves, a white gradient square fades in a slips just below the card. The view is relatively simple, but what is most striking is that the gradients on the squares create perception that there is a light source](./black-card/screenshot.gif)

### Features
- Styling creates the perception of a lighted scene

<br/><br/><br/><br/>


## Sparkles Universe
Inspired by the animated show, [Steven Universe](https://steven-universe.fandom.com/wiki/Steven_Universe_(TV_series))
![A background scene of a beach with an outdoor concert setup. A banner hanging from the stage says "beach-a-palooza". Layered on top of this scene are various, semi-transparent, diamond-shaped sparkles. Each sparkle is a different size, although all are relatively small, and they are slowly pulsing in size at random times.](./sparkles-universe/screenshot.gif)
