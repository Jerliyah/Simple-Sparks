    <div id="cosmos-page" aria-label="A soft black background with bits of dust, or maybe space rocks, perhaps stars. In the center, one can read the word, Cosmos, but it's not quite that simple. The word seems to breath, growing slightly larger and smaller at a calm pace. The O's move around the center, like moons in orbit. The path of the O's is visible, and creates a circle - this circle then reminds one of a planet, and this planet breathes with color, life.">
